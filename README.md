Missing value treatment

Encoding categorical features

Feature scaling

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Data visualization to understand relationships and trends

Model Training:

Linear Regression

Lasso Regression

Ridge Regression

Random Forest Regressor

Model Evaluation:

R² score

RMSE

Cross-validation

###📊 Technologies Used
Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Scikit-learn
